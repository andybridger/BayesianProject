# Bayesian Project

This repository contains the R code used to reproduce my research for an Bayesian Econometrics project I researched while undertaking my Master of Science in Economics at the University of Edinburgh.

The project was titled "On international uncertainty links: BART-based empirical evidence for Australia" and studied the international uncertainty links between Australia and other countries using a Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) algorithm.

- The R code to replicate the research can be found [here](https://github.com/andybridger/BayesianProject/blob/main/BART/bayes_code.R)
